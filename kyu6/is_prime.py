# Define a function that takes an integer argument and returns a logical value true or false depending on if the integer is a prime.

# Per Wikipedia, a prime number ( or a prime ) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

# Requirements
# You can assume you will be given an integer input.
# You can not assume that the integer will be only positive. You may be given negative numbers as well ( or 0 ).
# NOTE on performance: There are no fancy optimizations required, but still the most trivial solutions might time out. Numbers go up to 2^31 ( or similar, depending on language ). Looping all the way up to n, or n/2, will be too slow.
# Example
# is_prime(1)  /* false */
# is_prime(2)  /* true  */
# is_prime(-1) /* false */


def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1 or n <=0:
        return False

    i = 2
    # This will loop from 2 to int(sqrt(x))
    while i*i <= n:
        # Check if i divides x without leaving a remainder
        if n % i == 0:
            # This means that n has a factor in between 2 and sqrt(n)
            # So it is not a prime number
            return False
        i += 1
    # If we did not find any factor in the above loop,
    # then n is a prime number
    return True
